## CORE
The core of FinVM is a sophisticated data pipeline that transforms raw market data into actionable, AI-driven insights. It is architected as a multi-stage process, involving data collection, feature engineering, and a hybrid machine learning approach that leverages both supervised and unsupervised learning.

Step 1: Data Collection & Aggregation

The pipeline begins by sourcing data from two distinct streams to create a holistic market view:

    Quantitative Data: The system fetches several years of historical daily stock data for each Nifty 50 constituent from Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library. This includes the Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume (OHLCV) data points, which form the basis for technical analysis.

    Qualitative Data: To capture market sentiment, the platform scrapes the latest financial news headlines from reputable sources using requests and trafilatura. This provides unstructured text data that reflects market psychology.

Step 2: Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
This is the most critical stage, where raw data is transformed into a high-dimensional feature set. This process creates the predictive variables for the machine learning models.

Technical Indicator Calculation: A suite of financial indicators is calculated. Each is chosen to capture a different aspect of a stock's behavior:

    Momentum: The 6-month percentage price change, used to measure the long-term trend strength.

    Volatility: The annualized standard deviation of the stock's daily returns over a 126-day window, quantifying risk and price instability.

    Liquidity: The 60-day average trading volume, acting as a proxy for market interest and the stability of price movements.

    Relative Strength Index (RSI): A momentum oscillator calculated over a 14-day period to identify potential short-term reversal points by measuring if a stock is overbought or oversold.

    Bollinger Band Position: The stock's current price normalized to its position within the 20-day Bollinger Bands. A value near 1 suggests it's near the upper band; a value near 0 suggests it's near the lower band. This helps quantify volatility.

    VWAP Deviation: The percentage deviation of the current price from its 20-day Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP), indicating if the stock is trading above or below the recent "fair" value established by trading volume.

    Sentiment Feature Generation: The scraped news headlines undergo Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the VaderSentiment library. This model analyzes the semantic orientation of the text to produce a compound sentiment score from -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive). This score is then used as a numerical feature, allowing the AI to factor in the impact of market psychology.

    
    Data Scaling: Before being fed into the models, all engineered features are normalized using scikit-learn's StandardScaler. This ensures that all features are on a similar scale, preventing any single feature from disproportionately influencing the model's learning process.

Step 3: Supervised Learning - The Ensemble Prediction Engine

For its predictive task, FinVM uses an Ensemble Learning approach to mitigate the weaknesses of any single model and produce more accurate, generalizable predictions.

    The Prediction Target: The models are trained to solve a regression task: predicting the percentage return of a stock 10 days into the future.

    The Ensemble Models: The engine combines two powerful tree-based algorithms:

Random Forest Regressor: 

        This model excels at handling complex, non-linear relationships between features. It builds a "forest" of hundreds of decision trees on random subsets of the data and averages their outputs, which makes it highly resistant to overfitting.

Gradient Boosting Regressor: 

    This model builds decision trees sequentially, where each new tree is trained to correct the errors of the previous one. This incremental, error-focused approach often leads to very high predictive accuracy.

Step 4: Prediction, Interpretation & Validation

    The Final Prediction: To generate a stock recommendation, the most recent set of features is fed into both the trained Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models. The final predicted 10-day return is the arithmetic mean of their two individual outputs, providing a balanced forecast.

    
    AI Confidence Score: A confidence metric is calculated as 1 - normalized_difference between the two models' predictions. A small difference signifies high agreement and thus a high confidence score.

    
    Feature Importance: To provide transparency, the trained Random Forest model is analyzed to rank which features were most influential in its predictions. This is derived by measuring each feature's contribution to reducing error across all the decision trees in the forest.

    
    Model Validation: The system is built with the capability to evaluate model performance against historical data using standard regression metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R¬≤ Score. This ensures the models are rigorously tested for accuracy.

Step 5: Unsupervised Learning for Market Insights

    In addition to the predictive pipeline, the "Market Insights" page uses the K-Means Clustering algorithm. This is a form of exploratory data analysis that takes the scaled feature set of all 50 stocks and groups them into distinct clusters. This helps reveal the underlying structure of the market, identifying "tribes" of stocks that behave similarly, which can inform diversification strategies or identify relative value opportunities within a peer group.
